# Explr

Explr is a simple Android file explorer application. It allows you to easily browse through your device's internal memory, access files of different formats, and perform various actions on them.
## Features
### Internal Memory

With Explr, you can easily navigate through your device's file system. Clicking on a directory will take you inside it, where you can see its contents. Additionally, you can easily return to a previous location by clicking on an item in the navigation tray on the toolbar.

You can also perform various actions on files, such as deleting or sharing them, as well as viewing their details. Clicking on a file will open it or suggest an application that can open it.

Explr also allows you to toggle the visibility of hidden files and files inside directories with .nomedia files from the toolbar menu. Sorting files in different ways is also possible, and you can reverse the sorting order with the click of a button on the toolbar. Swiping down will refresh the files, but it will be needed only if some other application modifying files at the moment

### Changes

On every launch, Explr checks all files and gives you four additional categories to check at the "Changes in files" tab:

- New files: files that were created or moved since the last launch of the application.
- Old files: files that remain the same since the last launch.
- Changed files: files whose content has changed since the last check.
- Deleted files: files that were present during the last check but could not be found now.
